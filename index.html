<br>Further,  To Simon (1996), An artifact can be thought of as a meeting point—an “interface” in today's terms—between an “inner” environment, the substance and organization of the artifact itself, and an “outer” environment, the surroundings in which it operates. Following this line of predominantly design perspective, I am using Simon’s tripartition-- inner systems, artifacts and outer systems to encapsulate the adaptive dimension of entrepreneurship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

Most of existing entrepreneurship advise, and models(prescriptive and descriptive) on entrepreneurship are like apps. ASTRONAUT Loop framework is like an app platform(Android or IOS) which enables and even forces constant updation. Unlike real app platforms this framework enables and encourages you to learn, unlearn, add, subtract, design, create, combine, remix, recombine and customize solutions to suit the ever changing dynamics of idiosyncratic and contextual needs. Imagine adding(downloading) models, heuristics, analogies, concepts, etc. 
<br>{(Some examples are heuristics (Baker and Nelson 2005; Sarasvathy 2001), guidelines (Sull 2004), principles (Ries 2011), approach and techniques (McGrath and MacMillan 1995), framework (Blank and Dorf 2012), practice (Dean and Bowen 1994), process and procedure (Ackoff 1981), model(Fiet 2007), and method (Brown 2008; Ries 2011; Sarasvathy and Venkataraman 2011).}
<br>
<br>This means you never have to settle with one or two preinstalled apps(E.g. Lean-startup or Business plan). ALFA framework enables adding of more frameworks like bricolage, design thinking, user innovation, etc. 
<br>
<br>To our brain Cognition is cognition. For practical purposes there is no difference between X model or Y model. It either does make you think about something or constraints our thinking&nbsp;<br><br>The fundamental argument of ALFA framework is to stress the need to harmonize the growing collective human intelligence of both practitioner and academia developed models and bring it all accessible and affordable for the entrepreneurial actor at the time of his/her decision making and action.{{Dimov (2016, p. 25)  suggests that methods can be proposed Bin the form of  design propositions or principles on the basis of review and synthesis of prior research findings.^ }}<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">In complex systems like technology and business, past behavior may not predict its future behavior. A small change in any of the initial condition variables can result in a huge difference in the end result. That is why every moment in history happens only once. To predict an event accurately, we need to have a stable system with adequate data. In the case of complex emergent systems like entrepreneurship, history never repeats.  
<br>
<br>This is why when developing prescriptive models for complex domains like entrepreneurship it is essential to consider and design for factors of non-linearity, inter-relatedness, and emergent property. Most of the current dominant thinking in entrepreneurship is based on naive reductionism, which is an attempt to explain complex phenomena by defining the properties of the observable and measurable individual components.

It also involves the knowledge and processes involved in the appraisal, monitoring or control of cognition.

The meta-cognitive dimension in ASTRONAUT Loop framework on the other hand(T in ASTRONAUT stands for Theoria, which represents meta-cognitive dimension) is designed to have genetic properties. It constantly learns new ideas, models and heuristics to deal with meta-cognition. It constantly looks for biases, constraints, and pitfalls in the ASTRONAUT Loop framework as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

While entrepreneurship operates in the evolutionary edge of social emergence, most of the current thinkers and their models never truly acknowledged&nbsp;its massive uncertainty, possible varieties, and complexity. Instead they focused on One Size Fits All Prescriptive Models, Cliche advise, and Incrementalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>The Framework</strong><br>ASTRONAUT Loop framework is an entrepreneurial learning/thinking/action framework designed to capture cognitive&nbsp;diversity of all possible existing and emergent thinking( thoughts, models, frameworks, heuristics, analogies, etc) across <strong>9 exploratory dimensions</strong>. The framework then brings it all to the dispositional reality of the entrepreneurial&nbsp;actor by using the concepts of <strong>Affordances and Constraints</strong> across <strong>4 adaptive dimensions</strong>(1. Cognition 2. Agents socio-physical 3. Entrepreneurial Artifact: E.g The Product, Buz, etc. 4. Environment)<br><br><strong>ASTRONAUT</strong><br>The term ASTRONAUT is an abbreviation which enables dynamic emergent thinking along <strong>9 interconnected and inseparable dimensions</strong> of entrepreneurial universe. These includes End-User, Socio-Materiality, Contextual dimensions, Needs, Organization &amp; delivery system, Network &amp; Ecosystem Dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional Forces, and finally the Meta-Cognitive dimension of the Entrepreneur Himself Or Herself.&nbsp;
<br><strong><br></strong><div><strong>The Metaphor Of Overview Effect
</strong></div><div>The abbreviation ASTRONAUT here is inspired by the “Overview Effect", a concept developed by Frank White, indicating the ability to see the big picture like an Astronaut. “Overview Effect" is a cognitive shift in awareness which happens to astronauts while they are in space, often while viewing the Earth, This include perceiving earth as whole, organic, and with no borders or boundaries, etc.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>The Loop
</strong></div><div>The Loop represents a nonlinear thinking-action feedback loop, which often operates in-parallel along multiple dimensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br><br><strong>The framework works in 2 modes:</strong></div><div><br><strong>1. Always ASTRONAUT: </strong>This is the default mode of ASTRONAUT Loop Framework. This mode involves continues exploration and learning across 4 adaptive dimensions<em>(Cognition/ Agents socio-physical/Artifact(If any)/ Environment <strong>+</strong>) and 9 exploratory dimensions(ASTRONAUT<strong> +</strong>). The <strong>+</strong>&nbsp;indicates&nbsp;that you can add your own.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>2. SOMA Centric: </strong>SOMA in this framework means <strong>Socio-Material Artifact</strong>. ASTRONAUT framework&nbsp;considers entrepreneurship as a process of creating a SOMA. In the SOMA centric mode the entire attention of the framework narrows down for the creation of a SOMA. The purpose here is&nbsp;<strong>SOMA/ Environment Fitness. </strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><br><div><strong>Praxis Tools&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>We use <strong>Praxis Tools</strong> to work on SOMA(Praxis tools: Experimentation, Exaptation, Effectuation, Bricolage, etc) and Environment( Praxis Tools: Marketing, Branding, Lobbying, etc).&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Praxis tools are socio-cognitive-material tools we can use for the creation of SOMA and to achieve SOMA/Environment fitness.

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7"><br><br><em>I am a learning science enthusiast. I am passionate about the science of learning and expertise. This includes asking questions like “how people become experts at a particular domain, how they reach expert level performance? What is the difference between performance and success? What is the science behind practice or deliberate practice? Does deliberate practice always results in expert-level performance in every single domain?
</em><br><br><em>My passion for the topic of learning and expertise was developed and accumulated over 2 major stages of my life. First being an athlete and spending 10 years of my formative years as a long-distance runner, and getting exposure and experience of the science of sports and coaching.
Then spending a decade working in the competitive exam preparation and coaching industry(2008-2014) 
</em><br><br><em>After both of the above there was a third domain which I got bumped into, that is entrepreneurship. Somewhere in between I got exposed to Silicon-Valley and Boston-based thinking, which really made me extremely curious about the phenomena of Entrepreneurship. I started learning and reading about this phenomenon using every resources I could find. Soon I got obsessed with Ideas like Lean startup, design thinking, business model canvas, and many many models and heuristics which originated primarily in Silicon Valley Startup ecosystem.</em><br>
<br><em>Even though I was always doing some kind of service delivery business, it was In 2015 that I first jumped into action on an ed-tech product start-up Idea.
The idea was to start a novelty based learning environment like Twitter, as against Coursified learning environment like Coursera.</em><br><em>&nbsp;</em><br><em>I was full of enthusiasm and confidence, and I thought if I learn more ideas about starting a business I wouldn't find any difficulty in building a successful company.
This liner thinking about success came from my experience from two previous domains, Sports and Competitive exam.&nbsp;These two domains more or less share some common features which is absent in Entrepreneurship. These are existence of clear goals, rules, effectiveness of deliberate targeted practice, etc. We know that there are scientific principles, techniques, which if we consistently apply will give us positive results in these domains.&nbsp;</em><br><br><em>Of course, as you can imagine my startup experiment was a total failure. I had to windup within 11 months of our starting. It was a devastating experience and the psychological toll was huge.&nbsp;I was extremely disillusioned by the existing Entrepreneurship advice. </em><br><br><em>After this startup failure, I was able to spend a lot of time thinking about and reflect on that experience. My major reflective questions were the following; What did I learn and Where did all of it go? Why couldn't I remember all of those ideas I learned? Why wasn't I able to apply my learning to real-world contexts under pressure and uncertainty? What happened to all of the time I spent learning lean startup, design thinking, disciplined entrepreneurship? What happened to the information I gained from watching hundreds of hours of Stanford E-corner videos, Ted, OCW’s, MOOCs, etc? Where did all of it go?. </em><br>
<br><em>This reflection led me to think about the need for robust and realistic entrepreneurial thinking that can be applied(and adapted) to dynamic high-stress idiosyncratic contexts. This also led me to further my path of exploration to aggressively study the nature of learning in general and entrepreneurial learning in particular. </em><br>
<br><em>Over the years I exposed myself to multiple Learning-science perspectives(multiple theories, Multiple domains like sports, education, music, math, organization) and multiple Entrepreneurship Perspectives(Silicon Valley, Academic research on Entrepreneurship Learning, Education &amp; Theory, Contextualized View, etc). </em><br>
<br><em>I also spend an enormous amount of time learning about other Entrepreneurship relevant topics and perspectives from Domains like Sociology, Anthropology, Human evolution, Decision science, Bias &amp; Bounded rationality, Expertise, Psychology, Cognitive Science, etc.
</em><br><br><em>All of these explorations were pointing me to a single common theme. </em><strong>"The theme of Complexity". </strong><em>I.e. Entrepreneurship is a complex decision domain and without understanding and accepting complexity, it is impossible to conduct a real study on entrepreneurship&nbsp;or design a framework that can truly help entrepreneurs.
</em><br><br>Complex events like technology evolution, entrepreneurship, social movements etc are far more difficult to understand and manage. It’s harder to predict what will happen because complex systems interact in unexpected ways and with unknown variables. It’s also harder to make sense of things because the degree of complexity may lay beyond the limits of our cognitive ability and analytical tools.
<br>
<br><strong>This begs the question, What is complexity and why entrepreneurship is called a complex decision domain?</strong><br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7"><strong>What is complexity?
<br></strong>                      
<br>American mathematician Warren Weaver explained his Ideas about complexity in his paper called Science and Complexity, which is written in 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaver divided the problems of interest in science or scientifically observing something into three categories.
<br><br><strong>The first category he called Problems of Simplicity</strong>. These are problems that involve just a few variables. Some examples might be the relation between pressure and temperature in thermodynamics; or in population dynamics, variables relating population growth in time.   
<br><strong>He calls the second category problems of Disorganized Complexity.</strong> These are problems involving a huge number of variables. These are understood through taking averages over the large set of variables. To understand temperature for eg  we don't look at the particular position and energy of every individual air molecule. Rather,temperature is measured as the average energy over the trillions of molecules, may use methods like statistical mechanics, which deals with these kinds of problems. The important ideas here is, we are ignoring or assuming very little interaction among the variables. That's what allows us to take meaningful averages.  
<br> 
<br><strong>Weaver's last category was the problems of organized complexity.</strong> These are the problems of complex systems researchers. These are problems that involve a moderate to large number of variables. But the key here is that, due to their strong nonlinear interactions, the variables cannot be meaningfully averaged. Weaver characterized these as "problems which involve dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole".&nbsp;<br><br>Entrepreneurship comes in this third category. Complex domains like Entrepreneurship exhibit several features which cannot be taken account by most currently existing reductionist studies, models and perspectives. <br><br>Following are some of them:
<br><br>1. Irreducibility of elements—Due to the entwined nature of the elements, it is insufficient to focus on the effects of the single elements as the system as such cannot be reduced to them.
<br>course<br>2. Evolutionary dynamics: Complex systems are dynamic and constantly changing. Complex adaptive systems are often shaped by evolutionary dynamics. The mechanism of evolution starts with variation. Then there is selection of elements that are fit for the changed conditions. These elements flourish and multiply in the system. They may also change the external environment of the system, causing new variation. New variation may also come from outside the system. A new cycle of variation-selection-multiplication-variation starts. The system is never at rest. There is no movement to a knowable “end point” or equilibrium. There is constant change and innovation.
<br><br>3.Emergence: Complex systems show emergent behaviour. Out of the interactions between the individual elements in the systems behaviour emerges at the level of the system as a whole. This so-called higher order behaviour cannot simply be derived by aggregating behaviour at the level of the elements. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. This higher order was not intended by the elements. It is a spontaneous order.
<br>
<br>4. Interdependencies: The causality in complex systems cannot be described by linear models, as the causality is interdependent.
<br><br>5.Butterfly Effect and Black Swans: Relatively small changes may lead to large effects. This is the case if a complex system is close to a tipping point and it is therefore related to the non-linearity of complex systems. These are the result of the inter-connectivity of complex systems. Pressure may build up over time and then erupt suddenly and forcefully. Large events do happen more frequently than expected on the basis of the normal distribution of events. Events that are almost impossible according to the normal distribution have a low probability in a complex system. They are not impossible. They are so called Black Swans. They follow a so called power-law or log linear distribution.
<br>
<br>6. Nonlinearity/ Non-proportionality—The effect of an antecedent or input factor is not proportional to the strength of that antecedent. Due to the non- or disproportionality, small inputs might have a large impact, whereas large inputs might hardly change the outcome. <br>Effects are rarely proportional to causes. Instead, nonlinearities are the rule. What happens locally in a system, near the current operating point, may not apply in other parts of the system. a nonlinear system is a system in which the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input
<br> 
<br>7. Sudden transitions/ tipping-points/ non-linearity: Complex systems show non-linear dynamics. That means that they may suddenly change behaviour or move to another regime. They may move from a high degree of stability to very unstable behaviour. Think for example about revolutions and financial crises. A very moving description and literary account of the rather sudden cultural breakdown in Austro-Hungarian society at the beginning of the 20th century can be found in the book The World of Yesterday by the author Stefan Zweig, finalised just before he committed suicide in 1942.
<br><br>8. Self-organisation: Complex adaptive systems operate without central control. However, they are often characterised by a certain order. They, as it were, organise themselves from the bottom-up.
<br> 
<br>9.Fundamental Uncertainty Limited predictability: In complex systems like technology and business, it is harder to place bets because the past behavior may not predict its future behavior. This often makes the outlier more significant than the average.
<br>The behaviour of complex systems cannot be predicted well. Small changes in initial conditions or history can lead to very different dynamics over time. The existence of non-linear behaviour also adds to unpredictability.
<br>Complex adaptive systems are extremely hard to predict in great detail. This means their future is fundamentally uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>10. Path dependence: Decisions alter the state of the world, causing changes in the system and triggering other social actors to act. The new situation then constrains the path for subsequent courses of action. Hence, choosing a path often leads to irreversible consequences that determine the fate of the system, making it history-dependent.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">In an attempt to explain how our world works, science, for many centuries, used a so-called “reductionist” approach when a complicated phenomenon is broken down into simpler parts, which are studied and lessons from those studies are used to explain the phenomenon in its entirety. This approach led to many significant discoveries, but it also can be considered a cause to some significant failures, because sometimes the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  
<br>
<br>How human decision makers interact and make sense of complex domains like entrepreneurship can we demonstrated by using the parable of the Emergent elephant and 6 blind men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>My version of the parable has a twist from the original version 
<br>
<br>It's illustrated this way.
There were six blind men, one feels the ear of the elephant and thinks it's a fan and other touches the side of the elephant and thinks it's a wall, 3rd blind man grabs the tail and says this is definitely a rope, another one grabs the leg and says now this is a tree. The firth blind man grabs the Tusk and says this is a spear and the 6th blind man grabs the trunk and says now we've got a great snake here. <br><br>Each one of them were telling their version of the truth, and all of them were wrong.
<br>
<br>They started arguing and fighting. Their argument continued and they decided to go to the village guru to settle the issue. The elephant is a very large animal," said the guru kindly. "Each man touched only one part. Perhaps if you put the parts together, you will see the truth.
<br>
<br>The blind men decided to go back and feel the elephant again. "To learn the truth, we must put all the parts together", they said
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, they were never able to find the elephant in the same spot,  Instead their standing was a massive mountain sized Dragon..The elephant actually evolved into Khaleesi’s Dragon. The blind-men got exhausted looking for the elephant, and decided to take a nap on the rock hill nearby, which was act<em>ually the dragon's feet, assuming that the dragon here is nonviolent.   
<br></em><br><strong>The parable of the emergent elephant demonstrates 3 types of thinking models
</strong><br><strong><br>Blind thinking:</strong> The fundamental human bounded rationality<br><strong>Elephant thinking:</strong> The existing knowledge base, gurus, academicians&nbsp;<br><strong>Dragon thinking:</strong> The real and emergent nature of complexity, for which their exist no explanation, but only in hindsight.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">The blind men here represent Human Bounded Rationality. 
<br>
<br>In a complex and uncertain world, humans make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. Herbert Simon (1955, 1956, 1957) thus argued that humans have a bounded rationality. He suggested that the complexity of the environment and humans’ limited cognitive system make maximization all but impossible in real-life decision-making situations.
<br>
<br>
<br>Human Bounded rationality in a complex environment involves Heuristics and biases. Because of the lack of adequate information we use simple rules of thumb for rendering a judgment or making a decision.
<br>
<br>
<br>Another way to look at this is using the concept of "cognitive miser"  coined by Susan Fiske and Shelley Taylor in 1984 to describe the tendency of the human brain to problem solve in the most simple and straight-forward ways rather than utilizing more sophisticated and effort-intensive way.
<br>
<br>This simplification is neither good nor bad but depends upon the domain(environment) , and expertise of the decision maker. Its effectiveness in complex decision contexts are proven to be effective particularly when compared to formal models. 
<br>
<br> According to decision scientists like Gerd Gigerenzer and his fast and frugal heuristics program, If the heuristic’s structural bias is well-suited to the task environment, then the bias of that heuristic may be an advantage for making accurate judgments rather than a liability. This perspective believes this form of decision mechanism is evolutionarily adapted to deal with complexity
<br>
<br>But this inbuilt human method of problem solving also comes with a large number of recorded biases. Wikipedia page on human biases as of today lists about more than 190 biases which are all part of this category.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>For example, We use the availability-heuristic which is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. We have Confirmation bias, which is a tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms our beliefs or hypotheses. We are subject to framing effects. We frame our own decision contexts and we are also subject to framing of environment and other people, which Anchors our cognition and decision in a particular way, which is also called anchoring effect
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>Gestalt psychologist Karl Duncker (1945) showed that individuals’ familiarity with the way that objects are traditionally used prevents them from solving problems that would require a novel use. He called it “functional fixedness which is a cognitive bias that limits a person to use an object.
<br>
<br>We also have perception issues. We see only the things which we are looking at, which was demonstrated by the concept of inattentional blindness coined by Arien Mack and Irvin Rock. It is defined as the event in which an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight. Many instances of Invisible Gorilla Test conducted by Daniel Simons and others found evidence of Inattentional blindness. A much similar concept Change blindness is also a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a change in a visual stimulus is introduced and the observer does not notice it. 
<br>
<br>
<br>The manifestation of bounded rationality comes with a large number of information related issues. Jonathan Bendor Synthesized some of them from various sources including Hogarth (1987), Simon (1990), and Lodge (1995),  list following human information processing attributes:
<br>
<br>(1) Perception of information is selective: there is always far more information in our objective environments than we can perceive or attend to. Thus, perceptions must be strongly guided by anticipations. The main point here is not necessarily bias but top-down processing: perception is influenced by schemas and other mental constructs.
<br>(2) High-order information processing, especially conscious thinking and attention, is largely serial in nature.This has significant implications for the real-time behavior of busy operators, managers, and executives..
<br>(3) Compared to modern computers, humans process many kinds of information slowly. This is partly due to physiological limits: neurons transmit impulses much more slowly than do electrical circuits.
<br>(4) People are not strong at calculation,compared to computers or even calculators.
<br>(5) Memory is not photographic; it is actively reconstructive (Schachter 2002). It therefore lacks photographic fidelity.
<br>(6) Although there is no known limit to long-term memory, short-term or working memory is very small (Miller 1956; Cowan 2001). Thus, because everything that enters the former goes through the latter (Miller 1989, p. 151), the working memory is a key bottleneck in information-processing&nbsp;<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7"><br>Complexity and Entrepreneurship <br><br>
One of the distinguishing characteristics of entrepreneurship as a domain is in its inherant uncertainty (Knight, 1921; Alvarez &amp; Barney, 2007; Foss &amp; Klein, 2012).&nbsp;<br>
<br>  In complex systems like technology and business past behavior may not predict its future behavior. This often makes the outlier more significant than the average. A small change in the initial condition variable can result in a huge difference in the end result. That is why every moment in history happens only once.
<br> 
<br>To predict an event accurately, we need to have a stable system with adequate data. In the case of complex emergent systems history never repeats. This is why there will be no more Google, Facebook or AirBnB created twice in history. The creation and success of these companies are examples of emergent and outlier events.
<br> 
<br>This is why when studying complex domains like entrepreneurship it is essential to apply methods that consider the non-linearity, interrelatedness, and emergent property. However, appropriate methods are frequently neglected or not yet established among the plethora of available research methods
<br>
<br> According to Bill Mckelvey there are ‘‘thin’’ (quantitative)descriptions of entrepreneurial behavior, this means that very few variables are used to predict theorized outcomes. Alternatively, there are ‘‘thick’’ (qualitative) descriptions of entrepreneurial practice in which the researcher describes the rich interactions of many events, but only in one firm(for eg), at one point in time.
<br>
<br>According to Mckelvey, Thin descriptions are untrustworthy because many causal effects are ignored. Thick descriptions are untrustworthy because they are not necessarily generalizable to any other entrepreneurial setting. 
<br>
<br>He suggests a new kind of research called heterogeneous agent-based
<br>computational modeling, which offers a way to combine both thin- and thick-description research. To him agent models allow scientists to capture much more of the complex causality present in typical entrepreneurial settings. 
<br>
<br>This perspective of Maclevy is something similar to methods mostly associated with Santa Fe and elsewhere which is really
<br>about modeling using methods of computational complexity. An example study of agent-based modeling is the swarming behavior of birds based on three simple rules: follow the next bird, match the speed and avoid collision. 
<br> 
<br>Anthro Complexity
<br>
<br> Anthro complexity is a new field of Human complexity proposed and promoted by Dave Snowden to provide a critical view of the above-discussed computational study of human behavior.   
<br>
<br>This perspective suggests that we cannot treat human beings like simple creatures like termites or birds because we have self-awareness; we have intelligence; we switch between identity structures; we can exercise altruism beyond kinship groups; we have language, which is symbolic in nature. 
<br>
<br>This means there are huge additional levels of complexity when we deal with human systems. It's this concept that human beings are different and human systems cannot be studied by using computational methods 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Contextualized view and entrepreneurship.
<br></strong>
<br>Antro-complexity in entrepreneurship is very well captured by the growing literature of Contextualised view of entrepreneurship. 
<br>
<br>Most of the dominant perspectives still assume that entrepreneurship is the same all over the world, regardless of historical, cultural, institutional, social, and spatial contexts.
<br>
<br>Entrepreneurship is still a highly de-contextualized research field, which is also reflected in the popular prescriptive models we use, and also one-size-fits-all advice we give to entrepreneurs.
<br>
<br> According to Baker and Welter, the messiness and complexity of entrepreneurship derives from questions of who is driving it? A community? A family? An individual? Different social networks are invoked, spanning, friends, family, community, varied stakeholders. These are embedded within and affect special, regulatory, and normative contexts at the community, regional, national, and broader levels. <br><br>They add that economic behavior thus can be better understood within its historical, temporal, institutional, spatial, and social contexts, as these contexts provide individuals with opportunities and set boundaries for their actions.&nbsp;<br><br><br>"Complex indeterminate causation” (Hoffman et al., 2011). 
<br>
<br>Complex indeterminate causation  represents a situation in which rational individual decision-making is hindered by an inability to discern a clear chain of causality. “In real-world settings, the evidence for
<br>causation is typically too ambiguous to permit valid (i.e., deductive) reasoning, so [rationality] is not a generally useful standard” (Hoffman
<br>et al., 2011, p. 419). 
<br>
<br>Among other things, CIC offers an explanation for why some domains lend
<br>themselves to the accumulation of expertise that has been studied in much of the existing literature. Termed “Type 1 domains,” environments such as the game of chess, where it is relatively easy to establish a causal connection between proficiency at specific activities that can be practiced and performance within the domain, have provided the foundation for much of the study of expertise. 
<br>
<br>In contrast:
<br>
<br>Type 2 domains are ones in which the ostensive principal task goals involve the prediction of individual or aggregate human activity. Human activity fails to provide the needed cues for timely feedback, which is one of the reasons why it can be difficult to achieve expertise. At a collective level, human activity is subject to too many unpredictable events and decisions. (Hoffman et al., 2011, p. 405)
<br>
<br>
<br>Expertise researchers sometimes identify Type
<br>2 domains as problematic, and as one source of
<br>errors and biases that have been observed in the
<br>judgments of experts (Shanteau, 1992)&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>
<br>
<br>Business planning is defined as a process of ascertaining a series of potential courses to be taken by the firm, determining the firm’s position as a result of each potential course, comparing and weighing this position for all actions, and, on the basis of the evaluation, selecting the course of action to be followed^ (Steinhoff 1971, p. 3). On the higher level of logic, the business plan should offer solutions to Ba set of depen-dent and independent functional problems^ (Ackoff 1981, p. 52). The business plan is the formal statement outlining the process of business planning. It is con-structed around several functions in the internal organi-zation and several other external factors that influence the entrepreneurial process. Business plans deal with

<br>In highly dynamic environments, only specific activities are planned to speed up the starting up process, while, in slow environments, an in-depth planning is preferred.&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>3. Discovery-driven planning (McGrath and MacMillan, 1995)<br></strong><br>Discovery-driven planning is an approach that combines business planning with learning through a series of steps that reveal key discoveries (McGrath and MacMillan 2000). On the higher level of logic,discovery-driven planning posits that uncertainty can be reduced by systematically converting assumptions to knowledge and by redirecting its activities in the face of emerging understanding^(McGrath and MacMillan 2000,p.243).Proponents of discovery-driven planning maintain that, while conventional planning approaches are helpful in certain situations, they may be useless or even lead to disastrous outcomes in conditions of high uncertainty. Dysfunctional outcomes are largely due to reliance on untested assumptions. To manage the uncertainty, on the middle level of model, discovery-driven planning provides six areas of guidelines: (1) framing the desired business idea; (2) benchmarking the parameters that promise a successful outcome; (3) strategic translation of operations by specifying relevant organizational deliverables; (4) documenting, testing, and revisiting previously held or newly formed assumptions;(5) managing key milestones to reflect on actions taken and planning subsequent milestones; and (6) finding creative ways to run operations with a minimum amount of resources until major assumptions are tested<a href="https://www.fast-bridge.net/wp-content/uploads/resources/Discovery_Driven_Planning.pdf" class="text-primary" target="_blank">(McGrath and MacMillan 2000)</a><br><br>
<br><strong>4. Probe-and-Learn approach (Lynn et al., 1996).
<br></strong>
Gary Lynn published his dissertation in 1993. He had collected data from manufacturers of high-tech business and medical devices that had or were bringing discontinuous new products to market. The processes were vastly different from incremental product innovations that depended on traditional marketing research. He and his co-authors found a process they called Probe and Learn defined as:
<br>
<br>&gt;Probe - bring an "immature" product to market as a controlled experiment
<br>&gt;[carefully study the market results]

Business Model Canvas 
<br></strong>
<br>The Business Model Canvas outlined by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) consists of nine basic building blocks needed when creating value to external stakeholders. This could be viewed as a simple checklist that students can use when planning their value creation attempts, asking them to provide answers to key value creation questions such as “Who do you help?”, “How do you help?”, “Who helps you?” and “What do you do?”. It is particularly useful when working in groups allowing for sketching and discussing around ideas outlined by the team. Here too the language is business biased, but the principles are applicable to a wider context than venture creation. In fact, Osterwalder and his colleagues have written a book on how to apply these nine building blocks to personal development, which is well in line with a wide definition of entrepreneurship (Clark et al., 2012). 
<br><br>Criticism 
<br>
<br><br>
<br><strong>6. Theory Based View </strong><br><strong><br></strong>Teppo Felin, Alfonso Gambardella and Todd Zenger argue that managers and entrepreneurs need to develop their own theory of value. Based on their research, the authors provide the scaffolding—a tool called Value Lab—to help managers and entrepreneurs do this. The end-goal of their approach is to enable startups and firms to be more scientific and experimentation-oriented when creating new value.   Executive Summary<br>   To truly create new value, you need a theory. A theory helps you see what others can’t see. Contrarian or unique beliefs provide the underlying raw material of a firm’s theory of value. But beliefs are just rhetoric and cheap talk, unless you identify the specific obstacles and problems that stand in the way of realizing your contrarian beliefs. This puts problem-formulation and problem-solving at the very heart of your theory of value. Identifying the right problems allows you to spot valuable solutions, to find asset bargains and to make the right investments. Importantly, a theory allows you to be more scientific about value creation and to perform the right type of experiments. A theory allows startups and businesses to learn the right lessons from their experimentation and, if needed, to pivot accordingly. Overall, in the context of strategy, you can’t rely on generic approaches or best practices. You need to develop your own theory. It will allow you to see the world differently, to out-think competitors and to create value in unique ways.&nbsp;<br><br><br>
<br><strong>7. Disciplined Entrepreneurship. <br></strong><br>
Disciplined entrepreneurship Sull (2004) notes that instead of ignoring, avoiding or getting affected by uncertainty while trying to fight it, entrepreneurs should manage it by taking a disciplined approach. The critical task in entrepreneurship is finding ways to manage the inherent uncertainty of creating something novel. 
<br>Disciplined entrepreneurship offers guidelines for reducing the uncertainty of the venture creation process. Sull (2004) introduces three main guidelines and acknowledges that due to the messiness of the actual process these stages are not to be taken for a specific order of happening although it might sound intuitive that an order exists. The three main guidelines are as follows: 1) formulate a working hypothesis and be ready to modify it, 2) assemble the required funds and resources for conducting experiments, and 3) design and run experiments in an attempt to make the unknowns about the idea known. A working hypothesis is a set of assumptions about different aspects of a business, e.g., technology, customer demands, availability of resources, etc. These assumptions are just some guesses may prove to be wrong (Sull, 2004). Framing these hypotheses as subject to revision highlights their provisional nature of them. If managing a new venture is framed as conducting experiments, this allows a new systematic way of thinking about how much capital needs to be raised, which should be not too much and not too little since too much either way disturb the process. This, therefore, points to postponement of key hires until a stable business model is achieved. And, finally entrepreneurs use resources and the working hypothesis as the basis for running and designing experiments. There are two types of experiments, namely partial (to deal with a single source of uncertainty) and holistic (to gain information about multiple variables). Partial experiments serve best to learn more about the known unknowns (what one knows one does not know) and holistic experiments work well with revealing the unknown unknowns (what one does not knows one does not know).

<br>
<br><strong>8. Design thinking <br></strong><br>Design has been defined in many ways. Design could mean the creation of artefacts, it could mean problem-solving activity, it could mean a way of reasoning, reflecting and creating meaning (Johansson‐Sköldberg et al., 2013). For the purpose of developing a curriculum for entrepreneurship, Boni et al. (2009, p.409) defined design as “a process of actions and decisions aimed at producing products, services, environments, and systems that addresses a problem and improves people’s lives”, i.e. an inherently action-based approach to value creation. Brown (2008) pictures design thinking as a team-based iterative three-step process of 1) being inspired by the world through observing it closely looking for problems and opportunities, 2) brainstorming around plausible ideas for concepts that can help people and 3) testing these ideas on users through prototypes. Design thinking focuses on a creative search for what might be, instead of being limited by what is and what “should” be (Dunne and Martin, 2006). For teachers, design thinking represents yet another field where an emerging set of practices, tools and methods could be transferred and contextualized to an educational setting, supporting student learning and creativity. Students can ask themselves questions such as “How can we observe people in their authentic environment and reflect on their needs?” and “How can we solve their problems differently from anyone else?”. 
<br>
<br>Design thinking is Ba discipline that uses the designer's sensibility and methods to match people’s needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity^(Brown 2008,p.86).On the higher level of logic, design thinking is the application of integrative thinking to the task of resolving the conflict between reliability and validity, between exploitation and exploration, and between analytical and intuitive thinking^ (Martin 2009, p. 171). Design thinking is grounded in an iterative, nonlinear, and human-centered practice based on user research.

<br>
<br>criticism 
<br>
<br><strong>9. Design Cognition&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>(Garbuio et al., 2017) 
<br>&nbsp;<br>Design cognition perspective is developed as an entrepreneurship education perspective  prescribed to train students to apply four well-established cognitive acts from the design cognition research paradigm to opportunity creation. Following are the four; 
<br>Framing 
<br>Analogical reasoning 
<br>Abductive reasoning, and 
<br>Mental simulation. 
<br>
<br>This pedagogical approach is based on scholarship in
<br>design cognition that emphasizes creating preferred situations from existing ones rather than applying a defined set of tools from management scholarship.&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>10. Effectual entrepreneurship (Dew, Read, Sarasvathy, &amp; Wiltbank, 2009; Sarasvathy, 2001) 
<br></strong>
<br>Entrepreneurs do not start with concrete goals but constantly develop them on the fly through personal strengths and available resources. 
<br>
<br>Criticism 
<br>
<br>Effectual research is only now transitioning from a nascent to an intermediate state - A need for more empirical studies. 
<br>Existing findings are inconsistent, relying on a small sample size and relatively open-ended data that requires interpretation (Perry, Chandler, &amp; Markova, 2012)&nbsp;<br><br><strong>11.&nbsp; &nbsp;Entrepreneurial bricolage: Baker, T., &amp; Nelson, R. E. (2005). Creating something from 
<br>nothing: Resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage. 
</strong><br>
<br>Entrepreneurial bricolage Baker and Nelson (2005:334)–by borrowing the anthropological concept of bricolage (a problem-solving approach in which agents employ the resources available to them rather than seeking for new ones) developed by Lévi-Strauss (1966)–proposed entrepreneurial bricolage to explain the process of ”making do by applying combinations of resources at hand to new problems and opportunities”. Three elements comprises entrepreneurial bricolage: 1) ”making do” refers to a ”bias towards action and active engagement”, 2) ”combination of resources for new purposes” implies the reuse of resources for applications that were not envisioned previously, and 3) ”the resources at hand” emphasized as the pre-existing physical or intellectual resources that are available to the entrepreneur rather than acquired new resources (Baker and Nelson, 2005:334). 
<br>
<br>Bricolage as the development of an action-oriented or hands-on approach (Fisher, 2012) mitigates the limitations of the resource environment by using available resources in ways that were not originally intended and therefore reduces resource uncertainty. Bricolage as a strategy in environments with limited resources helps entrepreneurs enact its principles in five domains of physical input, labor input, skill input, customers-market, and institutional-regulatory environment. 
<br>By tolerating the inherent ambiguity of the penurious environment and making use of extant resources and opportunities, entrepreneurs can transform underestimated and seemingly useless resources into valuable ones with novel applications (Senyard et al,. 2014) and by that means progress the process of venture creation in idiosyncratic resource-poor environments. 
<br>
<br>Criticism 
<br>
<br><strong>12. User Entrepreneurship( and User Innovation) User entrepreneurship: Shah, S. K. (2007)&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>This  phenomenon has been labeled user entrepreneurship (Shah and Tripsas 2007). 
<br>The process by which user innovators become entrepreneurs differs from the 
<br>typical entrepreneurial journey. Users tend to experience a need in their own lives, 
<br>develop an innovation to address their need, and sometimes even openly share 
<br>their solution with others before commercializing a product. Many users are 
<br>“accidental entrepreneurs” in that starting a for-profit company was not the initial 
<br>motivation for their innovation, but rather the outcome of a journey inspired by 
<br>their own needs (Shah and Tripsas 2007). Surprisingly, user entrepreneurship 
<br>occurs frequently and across many industries: 46.6% of innovative startups 
<br>founded in the United States in 2004 that survive to age five are founded by users 
<br>(Shah et al. 2011). 
<br>
<br>A rich and distinguished body of research from a variety of disciplines has 
<br>documented the importance of user innovations (e.g., von Hippel 1988, 
<br>Oudshoorn and Pinch 2003). Anecdotal examples of user innovation have been 
<br>described in the literature for decades, but von Hippel produced the first 
<br>systematic documentation and theoretical development of the concept in a series 
<br>of articles leading to the publication of The Sources of Innovation in 1988. This 
<br>detailed and thorough body of work has shown us that users are an important and 
<br>frequent source of innovation and innovate across a wide variety of product 
<br>domains and user innovations may be qualitatively different than those of 
<br>manufacturers.<br></p>

entrepreneurial methods might appear to be a heterogeneous set of theories, the review suggests that
they are very similar and deal with similar issues.&nbsp; All the methods (implicitly or explicitly) deal
<br>with the notion of uncertainty, provide a set of guidelines aimed at reducing uncertainty in the
<br>venture creation processes, and offer tools, techniques and guidelines. <br><br><br><strong>Entrepreneurial behavior may have elements of all models&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>(Fisher-2012)<br>Context and Cases
<br>Fisher 2012 used the alternate templates research approach(Langley, 1999) to compare&nbsp;three theories at both
<br>a theoretical and a practical level.&nbsp; &nbsp;This include consumer Internet ventures launched between 2000 and 2003 as a context for this study.&nbsp; This group of entrepreneurs&nbsp; formed a “cohort” of entrepreneurs interviewed for the book Founders at Work (Abrahamson, 2007). The interviews provided detailed information about the entrepreneurial&nbsp;behavior underlying the venture founding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The results from this analysis&nbsp;suggests that the companies show a range of behaviors mostly associated with effectuation<br>bricolage, and also causation. Further the analysis has shown that there were no cases&nbsp;where only the behaviors associated with causation were responsible for the development
of the venture. This study reasserted Sarasvathy’s (2001) contention that both&nbsp; causation and effectuation are integral parts of human reasoning that can occur simultaneously, overlapping and intertwining over different contexts of decisions and actions” (p.
245).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Under emphasis of Complexity and emergence 
<br></strong>In complex systems like technology and business, past behavior may not predict its future behavior. A small change in any of the initial condition variables can result in a huge difference in the end result. That is why every moment in history happens only once. To predict an event accurately, we need to have a stable system with adequate data. In the case of complex emergent systems like entrepreneurship, history never repeats. 
<br>
<br>This is why when developing prescriptive models for complex domains like entrepreneurship it is essential to consider and design for factors of non-linearity, inter-relatedness, and emergent property. Most of the current dominant thinking in entrepreneurship is based on naive reductionism, which is an attempt to explain complex phenomena by defining the properties of the observable and measurable individual components.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Lacks consideration of Human Learning </strong><br><strong> 
<br></strong>Learning something at one point of time and using it adaptively at a different temporal decision context is extremely challenging. This is because isolated ideas doesn't sustain without connecting with a meaningful preexisting knowledge. Without the existence of meaningful coherence it is very difficult to transfer our learning to the adaptive, unknown and emergent contexts. <br><br>Another issue is assuming that we can teach something and be done with it. This is because knowledge is emerging and entrepreneurs are both users and creators of new knowledge. Providing enablers for continues learning is the only way forward. Most models are created by either management academics or silicon alley elites who never had any experience or knowledge about learning perspectives grounded across various disciplines.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Step by step linear&nbsp;process and Design Fixation&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Critical limitation of lean start-up and business model canvas and
<br>related approaches is their reliance on a structured, step-by-step process (Liedtka &amp; Ogilvie,
<br>2011), which may restrict their usefulness in dynamic business environments. Linearity may
<br>be an artifact of pedagogical and communication needs, but we have found, and instructors
<br>have noted, that proceeding in a fixed linear sequence can help students see where they are in
<br>the process and, more importantly, what knowledge they are gaining with a discrete stage. Yet
<br>design scholarship reveals that design as a fixed process does not work, as it may lead to
<br>design fixation, “a blind, and sometimes counterproductive adherence to a limited set of ideas
<br>in the design process” (Jansson &amp; Smith, 1991, p.4).&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Ignoring context</strong><br><strong><br></strong><br>Most of the models discussed above disregards the power of context. Effectuation theory pays insufficient regard to the substantial, pervasive and enduring influence of social-structural and cultural contexts on venture creation. Powerful explanations should conceive of venture creation as a sociohistorical process emergent from the interaction of structural, cultural and agential causal powers and must be able to theorise, fallibly, how nascent entrepreneurs form particular firms in particular times and places. <br><br>Context&nbsp; really matters: an entrepreneurial process can never be abstracted from its contextual 
<br>setting; an overt commitment to understanding context must always be an integral part 
<br>of appropriate process. The issue of the role of context—particularly community 
<br>context—in entrepreneurial process is a subject gathering considerable momentum in the 
<br>field (Hindle, 2010b) 
<br><br><br><strong>Issue of Agency</strong><br><br>Effectuation theory, in our view, suffers from a flawed assumption common to much entrepreneurship research: that of the under-socialised ‘heroic’ entrepreneur as the instigator of new business ventures (e.g. Armstrong, 2005; Drakopolou Dodd and Anderson, 2007; Johnsen and Sørensen, 2017). <br><br>In the <strong>descriptive sense</strong> most of the above models assume&nbsp; that entrepreneurs possess excessive powers of agency<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0266242620904638" class="text-primary" target="_blank">(Kitching, J., &amp; Rouse, J.2020)</a>.

We distinguish culture from social structure in order to propose a structure/culture/agency framework (Archer, 1995, 2013; Elder-Vass, 2012). To capture the interaction of structure, culture and agency through time, researchers must develop sociohistorical explanations of new venture creation that explain the formation of particular firms in relation to emergent social and temporal contexts.<br><br>We conclude that effectuation’s failure to theorise the influence of social context on venture creation adequately means that it can offer only an under-socialised, ahistorical account that implicitly grants nascent entrepreneurs excessive powers of agency.<br><br>we advise that researchers utilise Archer’s morphogenetic approach to theorise the connections between structure, culture and agency, in explaining entrepreneurial action,&nbsp;<br><br>Sarasvathy (2008: chapter 13; see also Alsos et al., 2019; Read et al., 2016) has invited researchers to ‘effectuate’ the effectuation approach by developing connections to other ideas, approaches and debates, including structure/agency accounts. A small number of empirical studies have combined effectuation concepts with other approaches. Examples include Actor-Network Theory (Murdock and Varnes, 2018); sensemaking and personal dispositions literatures (Jones and Li, 2017); role identity frameworks (Hannibal, 2017); regulatory focus theory (Palmié et al., 2018) and C-K design theory (Agogué et al., 2015). None of these studies explicitly adopted a structure/agency framework; they therefore do not theorise structural and cultural influences on the venture-creation process in the manner we proposed earlier.<br><strong><br>Lacks groundedness and Adaptiveness.</strong><br><br>By groundedness I mean based on the reality of the context with ecological&nbsp;validity.

<br>multiple strategies to formulate and solve a design need. The design fixation phenomenon severely
<br>limits creativity and results in pedestrian design solutions. Design fixation is the direct result of
<br>knowledge representation, with human knowledge argued to be organized categorically. These
<br>categories are defined by prototypes that exemplify the category. Humans tend to rely upon and use
<br>prototypes in their initial approach to design solutions because access to the prototype requires
<br>significantly less cognitive effort than does the processing of individual exemplars. The preliminary
<br>experimental results support the effects of prototypes in the design process. In the preliminary
<br>experiment, engineering students as well as practicing engineers were asked to design a toy for blind
<br>children. The results reveal a strong design fixation wherein the subjects failed to consider crucial
<br>issues such as non-visual senses (such as hearing), the age and gender of the customer, desired size of
<br>the toy, methods of retrieving the toy, and colour. The results also show that the design fixation can
<br>occur even during the problem formulation way prior to creating alternative design solutions<strong><br></strong>https://www.effectuation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Demystifying-the-Genius-1.pdf<br>, a critical limitation of lean start-up and business model canvas and
<br>related approaches is their reliance on a structured, step-by-step process (Liedtka &amp; Ogilvie,
<br>2011), which may restrict their usefulness in dynamic business environments. Linearity may
<br>be an artifact of pedagogical and communication needs, but we have found, and instructors
<br>have noted, that proceeding in a fixed linear sequence can help students see where they are in
<br>the process and, more importantly, what knowledge they are gaining with a discrete stage. Yet
<br>design scholarship reveals that design as a fixed process does not work, as it may lead to
<br>design fixation, “a blind, and sometimes counterproductive adherence to a limited set of ideas
<br>in the design process” (Jansson &amp; Smith, 1991, p.4).
Thus, design scholars suggest that problems and solutions must co-evolve to generate
the most novel yet feasible solutions (Maher, 2000; Wiltschnig, Christensen, &amp; Ball, 2013)<strong><br></strong>

In these situations people must amass and integrate, uncertain, incomplete and changing evidence. A major source of human error in dynamic domains seems to be a failure to revise situation assessment as new evidence comes in. This paper will be concerned with the identification of the main descriptive patterns of fixation errors and with how to build new sytems to reduce this type of error. It will also begin the process of building a theory of fixation errors.

<br>Fitness-Landscapes : Local optimization
</strong><br>https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/7802169/<br><br>Social science studies relying on the NK model follow on the path proposed by Kauffman [6] and study how the attributes of the search space influence the propensity of finding the optimal solution. Reflecting on the nature of genetic mutations, the default search strategy is generally local-search, that is, a one-bit-flip hill-climber [15, 25]. In a landscape consisting of many local peaks, a local-search strategy is likely to lead the agent to become stuck before reaching the global peak, which is why other search strategies are often integrated, e.g., random jumps or directed search based on a cognitive representation of the landscape [26–28]. The  ratio is an attempt to describe how rugged a landscape is. The more bits are interconnected compared to the size of the bitstring, the more interdependencies have to be taken into account when evaluating the fitness value. Part of the NK model’s popularity in organizational literature is due to allowing the investigation of different problem difficulties&nbsp;<br><br>hierarchical problems are likely to generate deceptive landscapes (cf. Figure 1(c) where the majority of the landscape would steer a local-search hill-climber towards a local optimum, which is not the global optimum), according to Malan and Engelbrecht’s [42] classification, since they generate so-called hierarchical traps where local-search gets stuck [49, 51, 52].<br>gg<br>The traditional NK framework assumes that, once a population becomes stuck in a suboptimal peak, it could only escape it if the fitness function was changed (e.g., shifting balance theory) or via a long jump. The neutral theory of molecular evolution relies on the conjunction that there must be a series of fitness neutral mutations that would allow organisms that were currently located in a suboptimal peak to “escape” and undergo further evolution. Neutrality has also been observed in a quantum physics experiment, where it rendered sequences of 1D parameter optimizations unproductive [13].<strong><br></strong><br><strong><br>
<br>fragmented claims
</strong><br>
<br>Hindle et al did an investigation which demonstrates that, as at the time of our investigation, the 32 extant models of entrepreneurial process are highly
<br>fragmented in their claims and emphases and are insufficient for establishing an infrastructure upon which to synthesize an understanding of entrepreneurial process that is both
<br>generic and distinct.  
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Universal Claims 
<br></strong>
<br>We have not forgotten. However, the majority of scholars responsible for the extant
models of entrepreneurial process have. Some of these models do claim too much&nbsp; universality in a way that fails to listen to alternative voices with respect. It is especially
disappointing to note how rare it is for those who posit entrepreneurial process models to
include reference to careful empirical work based on a wide consideration of the vast
range of work that entrepreneurs are actually doing. Many of the extant models contain
too little generality in a way that makes them not models of entrepreneurial process but
models of how to do some very particular thing in a very particular way. A naïve
subscriber to Van Maanen’s call for wide tolerance of a wide range of perspectives might
rest happy with the fact that our field contains a potpourri of over 30 models purporting
to describe entrepreneurial process.<br><br> The authors of this paper cannot be so sanguine. We believe this inquiry shows that <strong>the field is badly in need of an instrument that is capable
of harmonizing the best notes of “the polyphonic voices that comprise our highly diverse
field.”
</strong><br>
<br><br><br><strong>single harmonized model 
<br></strong>
<br>single harmonized model of entrepreneurial process capable of embracing the best of what is on offer and
<br>adding new theoretical arguments in areas where practice shows that they are lacking.
<br>
<br>
<br>This article demonstrates that there is an urgent need to synthesize what can be taken
<br>from the extant body of entrepreneurial process models as one component of a concerted
<br>attempt to derive and test what might be called a “harmonizing” model of entrepreneurial
<br>process rather than a “unifying” model. Our study does not indicate or argue for an
<br>approach such as that of which Van Maanen (1995) accuses Pfeffer (1993) of wanting a
<br>“Stalinest purge” of many uncomfortable points of view. On the contrary we are in total
<br>agreement with Van Maanen when he writes about our search for meaningful answers to
<br>important questions (p. 139
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>General and specific Hindle
<br></strong>
<br>A summary of the four models is provided in Table 4 below/Although each of these models provides some insight into what may be both generic and distinct about an entrepreneurial process vis-à-vis every other kind of process, none of them unequivocally passes the acid test of the double-barreled question fueling our investigation.
<br>
<br>The most important result of this research is that no extant model of entrepreneurial
<br>process passed the test of being both generic (covering a broad array of entrepreneurial
<br>contexts and activities) and distinct (genuinely focused on activities that could be demonstrated to be uniquely the province of entrepreneurship as distinct from any other
<br>process). Furthermore, not one of the models by itself was amenable to accommodating
<br>
<br>
<br>multiple perspectives of entrepreneurial theory. Each model demands that its users adhere,
<br>a priori, to a limited or highly prescribed perspective of what entrepreneurship is all about.
<br>For instance, an advocate of the Shanian perspective cannot without massive dissembling
<br>claim that this processual view of the world encompasses effectuation and vice versa. In
<br>our view, this study thus formally confirms the fragmented nature of academic thought on
<br>entrepreneurial process.
<br>
<br><br><strong>Self aggrandizing and self-perpetuating.</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Most ideas and models in entrepreneurship domain are self aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it give a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity. 
<br>
<br>ASTRONAUT Loop framework embodies a Work In Progress attitude. The model itself accepts its possible weakness. Everything about this model can be changed and designed to suit the idiosyncrasy of user and the complexity of the context.<br>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-4">One of the most important challenge of this framework is to make it easier for you to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if you had to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Definitions of the big picture thinking may fail to capture the real emergent big picture because all of it comes with framing effects. It often has unintentional boundary conditions wrapped into it by issues like framing, definition terminology, goals, cognitive limitations, environmental features, etc. Common imagination about big picture thinking may include temporal futuristic thinking , spacial universal thinking, conceptual big picture thinking, emerging technology thinking, or combination of one or all or others.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Big picture as a Map&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>&nbsp;<br>
In his book Streetlights and Shadows, one of the most respected decision scientists Gary Klein talks about the distinction between directions and maps. According to him:&nbsp;<br><em><strong>"When we have to travel to an un-familiar destination, we sometimes get directions—a sequence of actions (e.g., turn right, go straight for two blocks, then turn left).
Other times we get a map showing where we are, where we want to be, and the terrain in between. The directions are easier to follow, but if anything goes wrong, we are stuck. A map demands more of us but makes it easier for us to adapt and can be used for other routes in the same area."&nbsp;</strong></em><br>&nbsp;<br>This distinction between directions and maps is useful when thinking about most of entrepreneurship models. Most of the models are <strong>prescriptive directions</strong> and it lacks any systemic intelligence which a<strong>&nbsp;map </strong>can deliver. Most of the models are designed to have a specific purpose. This purposeful and objective oriented framing will narrow our attention to a goal. This reduces our ability to see the big picture, the macro structural factors.&nbsp;<br><br>Big picture thinking is like a map which transparently shows us the structure and components of a topography. A map as a symbolic depiction also emphasizes relationships between elements of some space(here entrepreneurial space), such as objects, regions, or themes.<br>A big picture map can help us represent and&nbsp;manipulate a complex set of relationships in a single frame. Maps make it more likely to understand
<br>those relationships, remember them, and be able to analyse their component parts.&nbsp;<br><br>Evidence from the cognitive learning sciences also shows that visual displays do enhance learning (Vekiri 2002; Winn 1991). Maps allow the separate encoding of information in
memory in visual and well as propositional form, a phenomenon called ‘‘conjoint retention’’ or ‘‘dual coding’’ (Kulhavy et al. 1985; Paivio 1971, 1983; Schwartz 1988).&nbsp;<br><br><strong>
Transparency &amp; BS Detection 
<br></strong>
<br>This big picture mapping also helps us build transparency. Transparency makes it easy for us and others to see the real structure and dynamics of a system.&nbsp;<br><br>In a complex and uncertain world we make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. This human weakness is susceptible to BS, framing effects, one-size-fits-all models and certainty merchants who comes up with confident universal claims. Further, people with disciplinary/domain commitments become more committed to disciplinary/domain boundaries and methods aligning perfectly with legacy incentive structures over time. Transparency provided by a big picture map gives us <strong>ability to contextualize and integrate </strong>new models and ideas with out excluding other ideas and models.&nbsp;<br><br>This also helps us <strong>compare </strong>multiple ideas and models in-order to examine its robustness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>Designing&nbsp;Entrepreneurship Big Picture Map&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>&nbsp;In complex emergent system an attractor is a set of states towards which a system will naturally gravitate and remain cycling through.&nbsp;They are islands of stability in a sea of chaos. Complex systems are inherently chaotic and unstable, but, they usually settle down into one of a number of possible steady states. These steady states are called "attractor basins". <br><br>For any system we can create what is called a state space that represents all the possible states that that system might take. In order to build this state space model we have to define one or more parameters to the system that we are interested in, where a parameter is simply a measurement of something about that system. <br>
<br>What we'll  typically see is that these different states do not go around every single state in the whole space but instead they are typically confined to a limited subset of all the possible states so we can say that this subset of the phase space to that dynamical system that corresponds to its typical behavior is what we call the attractor.<br><br>Some examples of attractor states are; Traffic patterns in a city in working days, Distribution of ethnic groups across many
multicultural cities, Distribution of
political opinions across the different regions of some nation, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Entrepreneurship operates in the evolutionary edge of social emergence. This means that the core aspect of entrepreneurship is about dealing with extreme uncertainty. But even in this uncertainty we can identify some stable elements which form part of the entrepreneurship. I have identified following 8 dimensions which form part of entrepreneurial complexity. These are&nbsp;<br><strong>1. Agent: </strong>Human Being or the kind&nbsp;<br><strong>2. Socio-materiality:</strong> The society and its dynamics. It also includes technology and material aspects.<br><strong>3. Context:</strong> Every moment of the an Agent's life represents a different context, which may include dimensions like Situation, role, and relationships, etc.<br><strong>4. Human Needs:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-94-007-0753-5_1345" class="text-primary">Human needs</a> are commonly used to refer to the drivers of peoples' actions, the motives behind human behavior.<br><strong>5. Organization and Delivery system:</strong> The fundamental function of an entrepreneurial organization is to cater to human needs. This is a mature form of emergence developed from the entrepreneur and his startup.<br><strong>6. Network and ecosystem dependencies:</strong> This represents the structure, connections and embeddedness of the organization in a ecosystem.<br><strong>7. Atmosphere: </strong>This include the features of the business atmosphere or environment. E.g&nbsp; 5 forces, PESTLE, etc&nbsp;<br><strong>8. Unconventional forces: </strong>This includes watching out for things which are unconventional, etc Corona Virus, Exponential Technology, Sudden Chinese rise,&nbsp;Cassandra.<br></p>

This comes with a lot of flaws which I have already discussed in part 2. This is why we need inbuilt enablers for meta-cognition. 
<br>
<br>Meta-cognition is defined as "cognition about cognition".&nbsp; It refers to the awareness of one’s own knowledge—what one does and doesn’t know—and one’s ability to understand, control, and manipulate one’s cognitive processes (Meichenbaum, 1985).&nbsp; <br><br>It also involves:<br>&gt; The knowledge and processes involved in the appraisal, monitoring or control of cognition.&nbsp;<br>&gt;Knowing when and where to use particular strategies for learning and problem solving as well as how and why to use specific strategies. <br>&gt;Using prior knowledge to plan a strategy for approaching a learning task, take necessary steps to problem solve, reflect on and evaluate results, and modify one’s approach as needed.<br><br>In this model Meta-Cognition involves enablers for identifying and fixing Biases, Fixation, framing effects, etc. It also enables exploration towards interdisciplinary intelligence which is outside the scope of this framework. It also aids in deciding when to use focused convergent thinking(exploitative), Diffused divergent thinking(Exploratory), Disruptive re-framing, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>https://lincs.ed.gov/state-resources/federal-initiatives/teal/guide/metacognitive

<br><br>T:&nbsp;<strong>Theoria </strong>representing Meta-Cognition&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Why using the acronym "ASTRONAUT" ?</strong><br><br>Use of acronyms are very common in the domain of management and business.&nbsp;VUCA, SWOT, SMART, PESTLE, etc are some of the famous examples. Even though acronyms are not generally considered the best learning method in all contexts, positive effects of mnemonic acronyms were shown particularly in situations where the order of items had to be learned and retrieved (Nelson and Archer, 1972; Morris and Cook, 1978).<br><br>Studies have further shown that availability of a pronounceable acronym provides a cuing structure whose inherent links between the different letters might strengthen the associations between successive steps (Malhotra, 1991)<br><br>Recent study also shows that acronyms could be used to improve the resilience toward detrimental effect of interruptions, at least at certain task steps of a procedural task.(https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02522/full)<br><br><strong>ASTRONAUT as a term representing the metaphor of Overview Effect experienced&nbsp;by astronauts&nbsp;</strong><br><br>The acronym ASTRONAUT here is inspired by the “Overview Effect", a concept developed by Frank White, indicating the ability to see the big picture like an Astronaut. “Overview Effect" is a cognitive shift in awareness which happens to astronauts while they are in space, often while viewing the Earth. This include perceiving earth as whole, interconnected, organic, and with no borders or boundaries. In many ways&nbsp;<strong>"ASTRONAUT Loop Framework"</strong> aims to create a same kind of cognitive shift, to make it easier for you to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if you had to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree). <br>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494420300517<br>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.540996/full<br><br><strong>Attention&nbsp;</strong><strong><br></strong><br>According to American Psychological Association attention is <strong>“a state in which cognitive resources are focused on certain aspects of the environment rather than on others.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><br>People's ability to pay attention has always been scarce. But what distinguishes today is the abundance of information, strategically designed at capturing our attention.  Advertisers always followed the time proven method of capturing attention first which is evident from models like AIDA in which A stands for Attention(get attention first), then generate I: Interest, D: Desire and A: Action.&nbsp;<br><br>Steve Jobs once said <strong>"it's a very noisy world and we're not going to get a chance to get people to remember much about us, no company is"</strong>. Thus designing for capturing attention is not an exception anymore.<br><br>I think the ideas proposed by this framework is very important and helpful for people. I believe naming it <strong>"ASTRONAUT Loop Framework"</strong> will help capture more attention than listing it as 9 separate items (End user, Socio-Materiality, Context, Needs, Organization,&nbsp;Network &amp; Ecosystem Dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional Forces, Meta-Cognition). It also inadvertently stresses the inseparability and connectedness of these 9 dimensions along with the metaphoric imagination of overview effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Cognitive Ease 
<br></strong><br>The concept of "cognitive miser" was coined(1984) by Susan Fiske and Shelley Taylor to describe the tendency of the human brain to solve problems in the most simple and straight-forward ways rather than utilizing more sophisticated and effort-intensive way. This is in a sense a tendency of our brain to seek ease. A much representative term for this idea is "cognitive ease" which recently gained popularity through Daniel Kahneman’s bestselling book "Thinking, Fast and Slow".&nbsp;<br><br>According to Kahneman; <br><br>“A general ‘law of least effort’ applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action.” In other words, our brains move toward what is easy to process and understand. We experience cognitive ease when information is presented in a way that requires minimal mental effort to absorb and understand.<br><strong><br></strong><br>When it come to cognitive ease&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>"ASTRONAUT Loop Framework" </strong>has 2 major facets of concern:<br><br>1. <strong>Surface</strong>: Make it easier for people to pay attention, remember, and spread the framework itself.<br>2.<strong> Core :</strong>&nbsp;Design to make it easier to find, learn, and organize the cumulative and emergent intelligence for entrepreneurs.<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-4"><strong>1.INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br></strong>Scott Page who is one of the leading diversity thinkers defines Cognitive Diversity as “Differences in information, knowledge, representations, mental models, and heuristic, to better outcomes on specific tasks such as problem solving, predicting, and innovating.” According to him random diversity will not do the trick. Thus to him, the character of the problem shapes the types of diversity required.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>In this section I am introducing the first dynamic aspect of this model, that is attempt to enable entrepreneurial cognitive&nbsp;diversity through design. <br><br></strong><br><strong>2. Why Diversity&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Evidence on the importance of diversity is overwhelming and can be found in many different disciplines. 
<br>
<br>When considering biological evolution, genetic diversity helps maintain the health of a population by including alleles that may be valuable in resisting diseases, pests and other stresses. When and If the environment changes, a population that has a higher variability of alleles will be better able to evolve to adapt to the new environment.  Thus genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele.&nbsp; <br><br><br>A second example comes from the success of  Human species. Why humans are the only species in the animal kingdom, created art and literature, social systems that promote large-scale cooperation. Why are we the only one with the scientific and technological knowledge to colonize the whole planet and explore space?&nbsp; Researchers have long been engaged in the search to discover the traits that underlies this extraordinary evolutionary success of humans as a species.&nbsp; Over the years, scientists developed many theories about Human uniqueness. This includes tool-making, episodic memory and semantic communication, etc. Most of these perspective failed to persist because researchers have uncovered that many animals also possess these abilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><a href="http://www.conservationandsociety.org/article.asp?issn=0972-4923;year=2009;volume=7;issue=2;spage=100;epage=112;aulast=Pretty" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Link&nbsp;</a>and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996468/" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Link</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2010.0370" class="text-primary" target="_blank">link&nbsp;</a><br><br>Scientists today more or less believes that the key to human success is cumulative cultural evolution(Boyd &amp; Richerson)/ (Tomasello ).<br><br>Many animals exhibit social learning and behavioural traditions, but , But human culture appears unique in that it is cumulative, i.e. human cultural traits increase in diversity and complexity over time". Human cumulative culture combines high-ﬁdelity transmission of cultural knowledge with beneﬁcial modiﬁcations to generate a ‘ratcheting’ in technological complexity, leading to the development of traits far more complex and diverse than one individual could invent alone<br><br><br>Another example of importance of diversity comes from<strong> AI and Machine Learning</strong> . This is evident from the fact that the field of artificial intelligence has shifted away from single, sophisticated algorithms to ensembles of diverse predictors(models).&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Scott Page </strong>uses the example of Google Translate software which relies on ensembles of predictors that scan the web for words, phrases, and sentences and learn patterns. These ensembles of algorithms outperform any single models or groups of people by a wide margin according to him. The <strong>Model thinking approach advocated by Scott Page</strong>&nbsp;further clarifies the application of ensembles of models to make sense of complex phenomena. The core idea is that many-model thinking produces wisdom through a diverse ensemble of logical frames. 
<br>&nbsp;<br><br>Further, we can find evidence on the importance of diversity in the <strong>field of forecasting</strong> from the work of Psychologist Philip E. Tetlock.&nbsp; In his book Expert Political Judgment (2005), Tetlock divides decision makers into Foxes and Hedgehogs.  He start by expanding the analogy from the quote by by Isaiah Berlin, “The fox knows many things; the hedgehog one great thing.” <br><br>To him, Foxes, those with diverse models tend to make more accurate predictions than hedgehogs, those who favor one or few models big idea.&nbsp;Hedgehogs have grand theories which they are happy to extend into many domains. Foxes, on the other hand are skeptical about grand theories, and are ready to adjust their ideas based on actual events.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Thomas and Ely (1996) showed that cognitive and experiential diversity adds to the perspectives available to the organization and
<br>encourages clarification, organisation and combination of new approaches for the accomplishing of goals.<br>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246749437_Making_Differences_Matter_A_New_Paradigm_For_Managing_Diversity<br><br><br><strong>3. "Apps" and "Tools" analogy of cognitive diversity 
<br></strong>
<br>The importance of diversity in a functional and problem solving perspective can be better demonstrated by using the "Apps" and "Tools" analogy. <br><br><strong>The power of a computer or smart phone is in the apps.</strong> Every apps we use and download can extend our ability to perform tasks which were impossible previously. Thus, WhatsApp helps us with instant messaging, Twitter enables direct interaction with users around the world, Gaming Apps allows you the to play games, Dropbox lets you store access and share documents, Google powers us with ability to access information. Netflix allows us to watch Movies and TV shows. 
<br>
<br>What if your devise comes with only few preinstalled apps, and you have no way to download new apps? Unless you chose to buy that phone for security or other reasons, it will be extremely boring and seriously limit your ability to do things and have fun given the possibilities that contemporary world is offering. 
<br>
<br><strong>Now let us think about a carpenters toolkit. Carpenters first of all need building materials like wood(alternatives) and other(e.g. nail).</strong> Carpenters may use tools like Hand Tools, Power Tools, Measuring Tools and Safety Equipment for their craft. This includes tools like Carpenter’s Pencil, Claw Hammer, Screwdriver-Set, Utility Knife, Mallet, Hand Plane, Chisels, Hand Saw, Power Drill, Circular Saw, Jigsaw, Sawdust Vacuum, Nail gun, Measuring Tools like Tape and ruler, table Saw Bench Grinder, Woodturning Machine, Safety Glasses  and Face Shield, etc. 
<br>
<br>All of these tools perform extremely useful functions for the performance of carpentry. Each of these tools are built to have objectives and solution for a particular carpentry problem. The pencil helps to mark things so that the cutting will be precise, the power drill makes the drilling effortless and precise, face-shield helps with the safety, and so on. 
<br>
<br><strong>What if the carpenter have access to only few tools and he cannot buy or create new tools?</strong>  Like the case of APPS this will also limit the possibilities of the person. The carpenter have to do carpentry with whatever limited number of tools he has access to. 
<br><br><br><strong>Further, what if the carpenter never even know about other tools and wood design possibilities? What if we are living in 1970's in which the conception of Mobile phones, Apps, and App platforms are alien to most people?&nbsp;</strong>This will not only reduce the possibilities in a functionality perspective, but also reduce the exploratory capability of the agent because of limited search space. With no imagination of models like App-store, Play-store, Google, Facebook, Power-drill, etc people cannot simply search for them or create them. If you don't know about something or at-least heard about something, it is unlikely that you will search for that thing. Similarly,&nbsp;<strong>Absent any exposure to inventors, people simply don’t become inventors. Knowing about invention as an activity is a necessary precondition to becoming an inventor yourself(</strong>Anton Howes )<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Like different apps expands our possibilities, like number of specialized tools makes a carpenter a better and productive carpenter, cognitive diversity makes us smart and adaptive. The tool/apps model represents people as possessing a collection of tricks or techniques to solve problems. If a person possesses different tools, then he is considered as a person with more cognitive diversity. <br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>People with few tools and limited exploration space can be further understood by revisiting the Parable of Blind Men which&nbsp;</strong>I discussed earlier. This is particularly useful when demonstrating how human decision makers with limited cognitive diversity(tools,apps)- search in a limited exploratory space without even understanding the complex and emergent nature of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In the parable of the six blind men, each one of them were experiencing the elephant within the scope of their search space and cognitive/physical limitations, as signified by the symbolism of blindness. They were telling their own version of the truth, and all of them were wrong. The village guru said, the elephant is a very large animal and each of them only touched one part, and if they put the parts together, they will see the truth. 
<br>
<br>By the time the blind men returned to revisit their previous assumptions based on wisdom of the guru, the elephant actually evolved into Khaleesi’s Dragon. The existing knowledge base of the guru never considered the emergent dimensions of the elephant. Since he never seen a dragon before, he never had the cognitive repertoire to understand the idea of a dragon and the phenomena of emergence.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>The parable of the emergent elephant demonstrates 3 types of thinking models 
<br></strong>
<br><strong>Blind thinking:</strong> Human bounded rationality, no cognitive diversity, limited search space, Limited tools/apps<br><br><strong>Elephant thinking: </strong>Existing knowledge base, gurus, academicians, Limited cognitive diversity, using multiple models in limited exploratory space, Multiple tools/apps.<br><br><strong>Dragon thinking:</strong> Understanding the real and emergent nature of complexity, enabling unlimited cognitive diversity, expanded exploratory space, multiple tools/apps, tools to make new tools.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><br></strong><br><br><br><strong>4. CURRENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP DIVERSITY PROBLEM<br></strong><br><br><strong>Entrepreneurship diversity problem 1: Single Model or Method approach&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Most ideas and models in entrepreneurship domain are self aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it give a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity.&nbsp; While entrepreneurial behavior in real world setting may have elements of all models(Fisher-2012), most entrepreneurship models like Lean, Disciplined Entrepreneurship, or Effectuation are by design exclusionary and self aggrandizing. In-fact every model has to justify its existence, and this justification often comes with the framing of other models as less useful. Its also comes with hiding its own weaknesses, or effort to extenuate exposed flaws&nbsp;<br><br><strong>A&nbsp;<br>S&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>T&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>R:</strong> Real Needs/Wants/ Choices
<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One single model approach: E.g. Business Plan or Lean or Effectuation<br><br><strong>O:</strong> Organization and Delivery System
<br><strong>N&nbsp;<br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>U&nbsp;<br>T</strong>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><strong>Entrepreneurship diversity problem 2:&nbsp;The OR field focus&nbsp;<br></strong>
<br>In the ASTRONAUT Framework, the OR field is the field between <strong>(O)</strong>Organization building and <strong>(R)</strong>Real Human Needs. Entrepreneurship models, ideas and ecosystem actors are by definition oriented towards helping the <strong>creation of venture by catering to the needs of users</strong>. Their existence is purposeful and goal directed.<br><br>This means the exploration towards other dimensions; Agent, Socio-materiality, Temporal and Contextual Factors, Network and ecosystem dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional forces(If ever happens) are framed by such goal oriented search. This is in no way authentic exploration and will rarely lead to great insights, and at worst may be loaded with confirmation bias. This kind of clear goals and definitions may hinder the entrepreneurs opportunities to develop divergent thinking that takes account of multiple perspectives and alternative views. The ‘rush’ to answers may lead to premature articulation of issues, which may result in the first idea taking priority over the potential range of alternatives.(<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0950422220963796" class="text-primary">Penaluna and Penaluna)</a><br><br>Further, entrepreneurial situations take place in dynamic event-drivers environments, where the evidence comes over time and situations can change rapidly. In these situations people must amass and integrate, uncertain, incomplete and changing evidence. A major source of human error in dynamic domains seems to be a failure to revise situation assessment as new evidence comes in. This kind of fixation errors maybe further reinforced by the existing models and thinking(woods).&nbsp;<br>

DIVERSITY BY DESIGN: DESIGN FOR COGNITIVE DIVERSITY&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Till now we have discussed&nbsp;the importance of diversity, cognitive diversity,&nbsp;and lack of cognitive diversity in the domain of entrepreneurship. In this part I am listing the three feature of designing enablers for cognitive diversity in ASTRONAUT Loop framework.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>a.) Components of cognitive diversity: The repertoire&nbsp; ?<br></strong><br>In his book, The Diversity Bonus, Scott Page takes the general debate on diversity to a step further, tracing the components which form part of the cognitive diversity, ie. “cognitive repertoires”.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to him a person’s cognitive repertoire is his/her unique thinking toolbox that includes:<strong>&nbsp;Information(data, facts)</strong> is facts you know about the world, for example the height of Mount Everest;&nbsp;<strong>Knowledge (expertise and knowledge in a domain)</strong> refers to your practical understanding of a concept or topic: this might be the best and safest way to climb Everest. <strong>Heuristics(simple rules of them, techniques)</strong> are the tools, models or strategies you use to solve a problem or generate new ideas. You derive these strategies from previous experiences with similar problems; they include things like trial and error and the rule of thumb. <strong>Representations(perspectives on the situation)</strong> are the way you see and categorize things &amp;&nbsp;<strong>Mental models(simplified)</strong> simplify complex ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In the ASTRONAUT loop framework I expand the scope of above list to include <strong>"Others",&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>to open up possibilities&nbsp;for adding other kinds of repertoire, and also reduce the rigidity to signify malleability&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b.) Entrepreneurship Specific cognitive diversity&nbsp;</strong><br><br>It is important to know that random diversity will not be helpful. The character of the problem shapes the types of diversity required. According to Herbert Simon: A "Wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.''. This means, in an information abundant world we have limitations of attention and our cognition is bounded. Another corollary&nbsp;of information overload is that even the narrowest of domains(subjects, topics) have massive amount of information, models, and ideas. It is impossible for a single individual to expose, understand or use even a small part of these information and models.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This is why we need a cognitive artifact which is specifically suited and optimized for Entrepreneurial cognitive diversity.<br><br><strong>c.) Entrepreneurial Cognitive Diversity In Emergence&nbsp;<br></strong>&nbsp;<br>Unlike the examples of Apps and Tools which deals with known world with defined problems, entrepreneurs operate mostly in the evolutionary edge of social emergence, i.e. the unknown world. They often operate in domains were previously known solutions/tools/apps are absent. This make it difficult to identify a stable set ideas which can be applied in all situations. This is why through design we must build enablers to create and find tools/repertoire on the go, via abduction and experience (design for emergence).&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>6. HOW IT WORKS AND LOOKS IN ASTRONAUT Loop Framework<br></strong><br><br>The enablers of cognitive diversity in the framework is built over the previously developed components of big picture map. This include the 9 exploratory dimensions;&nbsp; Agent,&nbsp;Socio-materiality, Temporal and Contextual Factors, Real Needs Wants and choices, Organization and Delivery system,&nbsp;Network and ecosystem dependencies,&nbsp;Atmosphere, Unconventional forces,and Theoria. These 9 entrepreneurship specific dimensions are a kind of enabling constraints for cultivating cognitive diversity for entrepreneurs. These constraints limit our infinity of options, channel our energy and create affordances(discussed later) for action. These constraints enable emergence and create the conditions for creativity.
<br><br>According to Paul Cilliers. "it is important to realize that the notion of a constraint is not a negative one. It is not something which merely limits possibilities; constraints are also enabling. By eliminating certain possibilities, others are introduced. Constraints provide a framework that enables descriptions to be built up around it. When dealing with complexity, though, these frameworks cannot be fixed. They are constantly being transformed, and therefore our models will always be provisional”.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>In practice the framework enables adding repertoires or materials for cognitive diversity including Information, Knowledge, Heuristics, Representations, Mental models, and Others. This includes opposing and contradictory ideas too.&nbsp;<br><br>The (+) represents enablers for adding more repertoires of diversity.&nbsp;<br><br>+

<br><br>For this, first of all ASTRONAUT Framework embraces conception of entrepreneurship as a<strong> ‘science of the artificial’</strong>, and practice of entrepreneurship as designing/creating artifact(Simon, 1996, Sarasvathy's (2003, 2008) and Venkataraman et al.'s (2012).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Further,&nbsp; To Simon (1996), An artifact can be thought of as a meeting point—an “interface” in today's terms—between an “inner” environment, the substance and organization of the artifact itself, and an “outer” environment, the surroundings in which it operates. Following this line of predominantly design perspective, I am using Simon’s tripartition-- inner systems, artifacts and outer systems to encapsulate the adaptive dimension of entrepreneurship. This tripartition is espoused to the core of ASTRONAUT framework as;<strong> Agent: </strong>Entrepreneur as a whole, his abilities and limitations to act on the environment, <strong>Artifact:</strong> everything related to the entrepreneurial artifact(product, service, venture) creation, <strong>Environment:</strong> The environment in which the entrepreneurial agent and artifact is embedded. 
<br>
<br>I am calling this part as adaptive dimension because everything we learned and understood previously need to be adapted to entrepreneurial contextual reality represented by interactive emergence of the three systems--<strong>Agent(</strong>who is creating an),&nbsp;<strong>Artifact, (</strong>for the)<strong>Environment</strong>. 
<br>
<br><strong>Further, I am making an effort to separate general cognition with the cognition which is 4E'd: embodied, embedded, enacted and extended.</strong> This distinction is not made to reduce the significance of any perspectives or to compartmentalize the obviously porous and enmeshed relation, but to<strong> enable facilitation of actionable knowledge and making knowledge actionable/usable</strong> for the entrepreneurial agent. This is made specially in acknowledgement of the contextually divorced and useless cliche advise which is extremely prevalent in the global entrepreneurship thinking space.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Representational Cognition(RC)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Vs<strong>&nbsp;Ecological 4-E Cognition(EC)</strong><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The foundation of traditional cognitive science used to be the representational and computational model of cognition (RCC). According to this model, cognition is a kind of information processing that consists in the syntactically driven manipulation of representational mental structures. In particular, cognitive processes were said to be computations over mental representations that are symbolic in nature.<br><br>According to proponents of 4E cognition, most cognitive phenomena that are studied by modern cognitive science, such as action, perception, understanding other’s emotions, etc. are in some sense all dependent on the morphological, biological, and physiological details of an agent’s body, an appropriately structured  natural, technological, or social environment, and the agent’s active and embodied interaction with this environment. Even most of the phenomena studied by traditional cognitive science—such as language processing (e.g., Glenberg and Kaschak 2002), memory (Casasanto and Dijkstra 2010), visual-motor recalibration (Bhalla and Proffitt 1999) and perception-based distance estimation (Witt and Proffitt 2008)—are not abstract, modality-unspecific processes in a central processing area either, but essentially rely on the system’s body and its dynamical and reciprocal real-time interaction with its environment. (Newen, A., Gallagher, S., &amp; Bruin, L. D. (2018). 4E Cognition. The Oxford handbook of 4E cognition, 1.)<strong><br></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>Thus the central concern of 4E is that cognition does not occur exclusively inside the head, but is variously embodied, embedded, enacted, or extended by way of extra-cranial processes and structures (Rowlands 2010a). <br><br>Accordingly&nbsp; this part argue that in real ecological context entrepreneurial cognition is embodied in that his cognitive properties and performances crucially depend on facts about his embodiment (Haugeland, 1998; Clark, 1997; Gallagher, 2000). <br><br>Entrepreneurial Cognition is embedded in that cognitive properties and performances can crucially depend on facts about our relationship to the surrounding environment (Haugeland, 1998; Clark, 1997; Hurley, 1998,). <br><br>Entrepreneurial cognition is enactive – that is, dependent on aspects of the activities in pursuit of creation of artifact(product, venture, etc)<br><br>Entrepreneurial cognition can be extended via the material vehicles underpinning cognitive states and processes can extend beyond the boundaries of the cognizing organism. Entrepreneurs use his networks and artifacts(tools, money, etc) to achieve this tools, money,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Finally, cognition is affective (Colombetti, 2007; Ratcliffe, 2009) – that is, intimately dependent upon the value of the object of cognition to the cognizer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br><br><br>The pathway of an entrepreneurial journey is, therefore, explained primarily in terms of the purposeful creation of artifacts as ‘contextual constraints’ (Juarrero, 2000: 39) on the process of emergence. The entrepreneur's design of artifacts co-ordinates previously
<br>independent parts of the emergent system and constrains the possibilities of emergent self-organization. While the emergence of
<br>an entrepreneurial market is self-organized by relatively spontaneous population-wide feedback loops, the entrepreneurial journey
<br>is self-organized by feedback loops within the ‘self-causing’ order parameters (Juarrero, 2000) of purposeful artifact creation. These
<br>dynamics, of course, do not preclude that problematic fluctuations can originate from Levels 4–6, which are exogenous to the venture
<br>emergence system, or from domains exogenous to the entrepreneurial system, such as the events of a financial crisis.
<br>The entrepreneurial system, as a whole (Levels 1–6), emerges through coevolutionary dynamics between ‘upward causality’
<br>associated with the bottom-up effects of localized action, and ‘downward causality’ associated with the top-down ‘enabling
<br>constraints’ of emergence at higher levels in the system (Juarrero, 2000; Lichtenstein and McKelvey, 2011). At the level of the entrepreneurial journey, however, the purposeful embodiment and embedding of entrepreneurial purpose in entrepreneurial artifacts contextualize the path of emergence, sometimes irrespective of objective constraints associated with market conditions (downward causation).
<br>This is what happens when ventures fail because an entrepreneur remains committed to a business idea irrespective of market conditions, or when entrepreneurial imagination creates new consumer demand that seems to have no connection with market conditions.
<br>A subjective artifact-creating decision can, therefore, be a critical event in explaining the route of an entrepreneurial journey, while
<br>that same entrepreneurial decision might be little more than an insignificant fluctuation in the context of wider population interactions<br><br>We combine Herbert Simon’s view of design with the common distinction between re-ality as discovered or created to develop experimentation and transformation as idealtypes of entrepreneurial design. Building on the design tradition’s view of artifacts, wedescribe how opportunities-as-artifacts iteratively develop at the interface between or-ganized individuals and their environments<br><br><br>&nbsp;By conceptualizing op-portunities in relation to human aspirations andconcrete situations, these efforts recall Herbert Si-mon’s work on the sciences of the artificial, and inparticular his account of design as involving “a re-lation among three terms: the purpose or goal, thecharacter of the artifact, and the environment inwhich the artifact performs”(Simon, 1996: 5<br><br><br>In line with these suggestions, the purpose of thispaper is to conceptualize entrepreneurship as a formof design (Berglund, Dimov, &amp; Wennberg, 2018;Dimov, 2016; Ding, 2019; Sarasvathy, 2004, 2008;Romme, 2016; Venkataraman et al., 2012), withspecial emphasis on how opportunities-as-artifactsiteratively develop at the interface between orga-nized individuals and their environments.<br><br><br>The bulk of the paper is then spent combiningexisting entrepreneurship theory with insights fromdesign, information systems, and practice theory inorder to elaborate experimentation and transforma-tion as ideal types that rest on fundamentally differentassumptions regarding: the individuals involved inthe venture and how they are organized (the innersystem), the environments in which they operate (theouter system), and the design artifacts and designprinciples through which these are related (the inter-face).<br><br>In contrast, scholars operating within a designparadigm (Gregor &amp; Hevner, 2013; March &amp; Smith,1995; Simon, 1996; Vincenti, 1990) treat phenomenaas artificial—that is, as designed to achieve particulargoals in light of environmental circumstances.<br><br><br>In developing the design perspective of entre-preneurship, we take as our point of departure theestablished distinction between viewing the exter-nal environment as discovered or created (Hacking,1999; Searle, 1995; cf. Alvarez &amp; Barney, 2007), whichtranslates into very different ways of conceptualizingand managing environmental uncertainty. Statedbriefly, with a discovery view, uncertainty is epistemicin the sense that it is overcome through the discovery ofinformation about an in-principle knowable and inde-pendently existing environment. With a creation view,uncertainty is instead ontological in the sense that it isovercome by creating the environment anew.This is then combined with Simon’s tripartitionof design into inner systems, outer systems, andthe artifacts designed at their interface. This dis-tinguishing of opportunities-as-artifacts from bothindividuals and the environments in which they<br><br><br><br>Environments as Discovered or CreatedDiscovered. Experimentation is premised on theidea that relevant aspects of the external environment—such as technologies, institutions, demographic trends,consumer sentiments, and market demand (Drucker,1985; Shane, 2003)—exist independently of the per-ceptions and actions of the entrepreneur (Dean &amp;McMullen, 2007). The environment therefore pro-vides the enablers and constraints (Davidsson, 2015)that determine the fundamental viability (Ramoglou&amp; Tsang, 2016) and circumscribe the potential value(Shane, 2003, 2012) of any envisioned opportunity.Entrepreneurship scholars have variously attributedsuch environmental realness to empirically observ-able entities (Alvarez &amp; Barney, 2010), in principleunobservable mechanisms (Ramoglou, 2013), andstable yet socially constructed institutions (Tolbert,David, &amp; Sine, 2011). However, as long as the externalenvironment can be treated as objective and inde-pendent, such meta-theoretical differences are incon-sequential from the perspective of entrepreneurship asdesign.Created. Transformation is premised on the ideathat relevant aspects of the world—such as industrystandards, regulations, market segments, and prod-uct categories (Lane &amp; Maxfield, 2005; Santos &amp;Eisenhardt, 2009)—exist primarily as social con-structions that are sustained or altered throughongoing human action and interaction (Dew &amp;Sarasvathy, 2007; Garud, Jain, &amp; Tuertscher, 2008).Precisely because they are historically and contin-gently evolved, they are also seen as rife with ten-sions and contradictions that entrepreneurs canleverage to effect desirable environmental change(Barley &amp; Tolbert, 1997; Fligstein, 1997; Seo &amp; Creed,2002). From the perspective of entrepreneurshipas design, the environment is thus very much opento influence (Engel, Kaandorp, &amp; Elfring, 2017;Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005a). Hence, uncertainty isovercome not by gathering correct information aboutthe external environment but by participating in aprocess of gradually transforming it (Aldrich &amp;Martinez, 2003; Alvarez, Young, &amp; Woolley, 2015;Santos &amp; Eisenhardt, 2009; Uzunca, Rigtering, &amp;Ozcan, 2018; Wiltbank, Dew, Read, &amp; Sarasvathy,2006). Here, it should be noted that participation inprocesses of social construction are difficult to con-strain, which makes it hard to draw a sharp line be-tween the environment as an outer system and theindividuals making up the inner system (Baker, 2007;Garud et al., 2008; Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005a; West,2007). As we will see in the discussions of heter-archies and negotiation, this blurring of boundariesis central to many aspects of transformation.Individuals Organized in Hierarchiesor HeterarchiesHierarchies. Experimentation assumes that a realand independent external environment exists, andthat entrepreneurs only have limited informationabout this environment (Milliken, 1987). Specifi-cally, opportunities are subjectively envisioned(Packard, Clark, &amp; Klein, 2017) on the basis of expe-riential and observational fragments (Felin &amp; Zenger,2009) that are accumulated and reinterpreted over anentire life history (Berglund, 2015). Since the verac-ity of such subjective opportunity visions cannot beestablished using rational arguments and public in-formation (Knight, 1921) they cannot easily betraded (Foss &amp; Klein, 2012).&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>1.  Entrepreneurial Agent  
<br></strong>
<br>Entrepreneurial Agent is the person who is engaged in the venture creation process. This part involves Entrepreneur as a whole, his abilities and limitations to act on the environment. <br><br>So, what is an opportunity? Let’s answer this question by attempting to construct one.
<br>We need two sets of elements, agents and artifacts. Some of the agents act as consumers and
<br>what they consume is an artifact, i.e. product or service. Other agents act as providers of labor
<br>or other artifacts to help produce the artifact to be consumed. The entrepreneur(s) is yet another
<br>agent who controls the focal product or service and thus brings together the production and
<br>consumption sides. The opportunity is not the simple collection of such agents and artifacts.
<br>Its essence lies in the set of particular relationships created among them. Each relationship
<br>denotes a pattern of interaction between actors. It represents an ongoing exchange activity such
<br>as employment, supply, production, distribution, and consumption and is an indelible part of
<br>the realization of the opportunity<br>
<br>
<br><strong>2. Artifact: This part is about everything related to the entrepreneurial artifact creation  
<br></strong>
<br>Building on Sarasvathy's (2003, 2008) and Venkataraman et al.'s (2012) conception of entrepreneurship inquiry as a ‘science of the artificial’ (Simon, 1996),  Similarly, opportunities can be portrayed as artifacts arising from the actions 
<br>and interactions of entrepreneurs (Venkataraman, Sarasvathy, Dew, and Forster, 2012)
<br><br>Building on Sarasvathy's (2003) and Venkataraman et al.'s (2012) proposal that entrepreneurial is a ‘science of the artificial’
<br>(Simon, 1962, 1973/1977, 1996), we conceptualize the emergent outcomes of the entrepreneurial journey in terms of the design of
<br>entrepreneurial artifacts at different levels in an emergent hierarchical system. From this perspective, the entrepreneurial journey
<br>emerges according to the principle that abstract entrepreneurial artifacts created at lower levels are designed as contextual to the
<br>emergence of more tangible artifacts at higher levels. The entrepreneurial journey is, therefore, a unit of analysis for the explanation
<br>of an entrepreneurial event in terms of the explanatory significance of prior artifact emergence. In this article, we develop the notion
<br>of the entrepreneurial journey as an emergent hierarchical system of artifact-creating processes and explore the analytical and operational significance of this framework for process theory development.<br><br>Artifacts include the firms, markets, and economies that originate from entrepreneurs’ decision
<br>processes as they create and grow firms in the real world (Sarasvathy, 2001). E<br><br><br>). From an ‘artifactual science’ perspective
<br>(Sarasvathy, 2008), an entrepreneurial journey, therefore, emerges according to the principle that abstract artifacts created at
<br>lower levels are designed as contextual to the emergence of more tangible artifacts at higher levels (Cf. Lichtenstein and
<br>Kurjanowicz's, 2010, notion of ‘degrees of emergence’). Emergent artifacts then function as ‘enabling constraints’ (Juarrero, 2000)
<br>on the entrepreneurial journey in terms of extending system capabilities and constraining activity at lower levels. The entrepreneurial
<br>journey is, therefore, a key unit of analysis in terms of the contextual significance of prior artifact emergence for entrepreneurial
<br>events<br><br>
When a system is reproduced,
<br>artifacts are reproduced, and when a system is emergent, new artifacts are created.
<br>Entrepreneurial inquiry can be viewed as a science of the artificial in the sense that entrepreneurs design artifacts that are functional
<br>to the creation of entrepreneurial markets under conditions of genuine uncertainty (Sarasvathy, 2003, 2008; Venkataraman et al., 2012).
<br>Sarasvathy (2003, 2008) and Venkataraman et al. (2012) refer to entrepreneurial artifacts as ventures, firms, commodities, opportunities
<br>and markets<br>
<br>At Level 1, an entrepreneurial sense-making subsystem creates a business idea (artifact), which is functional to interaction in
<br>entrepreneur–stakeholder subsystems, and the emergence of an operational business model (artifact), at Level 2. At Level 3, the
<br>operational business model, created at Level 2, is functional to the emergence of firm capabilities (artifacts) and marketable commodities (artifacts) in the entrepreneurial firm subsystem. Thereafter, the marketing of a commodity is functional to the emergence of either a Kirznerian or Schumpeterian market system (artifact) at Level 4, and this market system is then functional to the formation of
<br>firm clusters and regional business relationships (artifacts) at Level 5. Levels 1–5 are functional to the wider societal emergence of entrepreneurial culture, discourse and practices (artifacts) at Level 6<br><br><strong>3. Environment: The environment in which the entrepreneur is operating. 
<br></strong>
<br>In the face of dynamic external conditions, formalized and predictive behavior as propsed by many of the above discussed models might create internal rigidities. As a consequence, an organization's commitment to plans and regulations can result in lower degrees of adaptation to external changes and lower performance (Mosakowski, 1997; Haveman, 1992). Because dynamic environments imply information gaps and uncertainty of information, the <br><br> 
&nbsp;In this sense, opportunity as social structure is a design artifact that
<br>arises at the intersection of entrepreneurial intent with the constraints of the economic, social,
<br>and technical context.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dimo-Dimov-7/publication/297738216_Toward_a_Design_Science_of_Entrepreneurship/links/59f44dcdaca272607e293b2b/Toward-a-Design-Science-of-Entrepreneurship.pdf<br><br>Artifacts include the firms, markets, and economies that originate from entrepreneurs’ decision
<br>processes as they create and grow firms in the real world (Sarasvathy, 2001). E<br><br><br>The subsystems that constitute the complex system of the human body, for example, are spatially organized within the body as a physical entity. In contrast, the interaction of subsystems and subsystem components in social systems is unconstrained by spatial
<br>proximity because interaction is mediated by ‘symbolic meaning systems’ (Simon, 1962: 469–470).<br><br><br>The nature and function of social artifacts are, therefore, quite different to the nature and function of physical and biological artifacts. Artifacts in physical and biological systems are created by ‘fitting’ the material and biochemical properties of a subsystem with
<br>its environment. For example, in the context of the human body, glands are subsystems that produce hormones, which regulate and
<br>‘fit’ a bodily system (e.g. homeostasis). Social artifacts, on the other hand, are a medium of social interaction. Social interaction is mediated by the intentional creation of social artifacts and the subjective interpretation of social artifacts in relation to symbolic meaning
<br>systems. Social artifacts, therefore, mediate an indeterminate number of social interactions and are manifest in a variety of artifactual
<br>forms. These forms include linguistic artifacts, such as ideas and texts, relational artifacts, such as networks and organizations, and material artifacts, such as commodities and technologies.
<br>The embodiment and embedding of human intention in social artifacts distinguish social hierarchies from physical and biological
<br>hierarchies in the following ways. Firstly, social subsystems and subsystem components have a higher degree of independence (near
<br>decomposability), than in physical and biological systems, because interaction is mediated by the subjective interpretation of social
<br>artifacts (Simon, 1962: 469–470). For example, the emergence of a business model might be contingent on agreement in the subjective interpretations of an entrepreneur and stakeholder. Secondly, the capacity to embody and embed human intention in different
<br>artifactual forms means that the same human agent can organize ‘phases of organizing’ and ‘degrees of emergence’ at different hierarchical levels (Lichtenstein and Kurjanowicz, 2010). For example, an entrepreneur can formulate a business idea (Level 1), then negotiate a business model (Level 2) and then implement the business model (Level 3). Thirdly, the causal significance of social artifacts
<br>is mediated by authority relations and the control of resources. Consequently, entrepreneurs and stakeholders have a degree of control over the parameters of emergence in the venture emergence system. In short, the artifact-creating activities of some types of
<br>agents in a social system, such as entrepreneurs, can have a greater causal significance for the path of artifact emergence than
<br>other types of agents.

<br>Practitioner-grounded entrepreneurial methods have met with criticism for lacking theoretical rigor (Wood 2000), which has led to undesirable consequences, such as entrepreneurs giving up prematurely (Heitmann 2014). Scholarly grounded entrepreneurial methods

<br>When studying human decision making, separating the contexts of the interaction can lead to models with low ecological validity that do not generalize well to life outside the lab. Ecological validity thus refers to the extent to which the findings of a research study are able to be generalized to real-life settings.

<br>For example, in a simulator assessment of driving, a study in which a participant drove with a steering wheel would have more ecological validity than one in which the participant drove by moving the cursor of a computer with a mouse.

<br>The early phases of conceptual design require careful consideration as early decisions will have substantial influence on the new system, ultimately enabling or limiting success of the sys-tem over time. Measuring a system‟s “ilities” such as changeability, adaptability, flexibility, and survivability, gives stakeholders and decision makers an enhanced basis for differentiating be-tween design alternatives. In the face of changing contexts or needs, called epochs, systems can be designed to change in response, or remain robust, in order to retain useful functionality to avoid suffering deficiencies and even failure. Designing an evolvable system may reduce the long term cost of system upgrades or replacements in the presence of epoch shifts over its life-span.

<br>
<br>Why should a design team bother to design for evolvability? Several considerations go into this decision based on timing and needs: (1) how often will available technologies change?, (2) how often will requirements change?, (3) what is the life cycle of the system?, and (4) is the sys-tem part of a larger system of systems? The idea of comparing a technology development cycle to a system development cycle is not a new one. In Axiomatic Design, (Suh 1990, p 376) ex-plains that “in some industries, products become obsolete so rapidly that the product develop-ment cycle – the lead time for product development – must become shorter and shorter to keep up with competition and customer demand.” An evolvable design ideally accommodates faster change (requiring less effort and resources) and thus is better suited for rapid modification in the presence of new requirements and/or available technologies&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>
<br>In an 
<br>educational context, Nordlander, Strandh and Brännlund (2013, 3) identify that agency is: 
<br>possessed by ‘someone who acts and bring about change’ (Sen 1999, 31). Furthermore, 
<br>the ability to act and effect change – agency – is a social process in which the individual 
<br>can contextualise past experience and habits (habitual aspect) and entails a capacity to 
<br>imagine and act on alternative possibilities of the present and the future (Emirbayer and 
<br>Mische 1998).
<br>
<br>
<br>Education can reinforce hegemony, or 
<br>it can become a space in which to create dialogue between academics and students, supporting 
<br>each other to understand and re-create the world (Freire 1994; Degener 2001). By making 
<br>students aware of their political positioning and hegemonic constructs, valuing the knowledge 
<br>that students bring rather than subjugating it, and opening up dialogue around ideas and 
<br>curricula, teachers grant students agency and they are then better able to critique, challenge or 
<br>change existing structures (Degener 2001)
<br>
<br>
<br>Agency. The concept of agency is rooted in social psychology, where it is described as an 
<br>individual’s ability, at any given point in time, to act independently in order to change the 
<br>internal or external environment (Bandura, 2001; Campbell, 2009; Hitlin &amp; Elder, 2007).
<br>
<br>In the context of education, learner agency was defined by Ferguson, Phillips, Rowley, and Friedlander 
<br>(2015), in their report for The Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University, as “the 
<br>capacity and propensity to take purposeful initiative—the opposite of helplessness” (p. 1). 
<br>Additionally, van Lier (2008) proposed several popular and widely-cited criteria that are a 
<br>synthesis of several prominent authors on agency. In order for a student to be exercising learner 
<br>agency, a) the student must be acting on their own initiative, potentially as a form of selfregulation; b) the act must occur within and be mediated by a sociocultural context, such as a 
<br>classroom, workplace, or community; and c) the student must be aware of their responsibility for 
<br>the act, such as its effect on others (van Lier, 2008)
<br>https://digital.sandiego.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=soles-student-projects
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>This is essential for true social inclusion; as 
<br>Nordlander, Strandh and Brännlund observe “the capability of agency – the ability, at least to 
<br>some extent, to be an agent of one’s own life – is closely connected with the opportunity to act as 
<br>a full member of a social context” (2013, 3).
<br>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305355179_Agents_for_Change_Applying_Critical_Pedagogy_in_Enabling_Programs
<br>Once designed and introduced into the interactional scene by humans, texts, artefacts and objects of any kind make sense and have an agency on their own (Latour 1996). They make a difference and have effects thanks to us but also despite us. We might use them, “but [we] also might be at their mercy” (Brummans 2007, 724). 
<br>
<br>In other words, an individual must be capable of behaving effectively in a given situation, aware 
<br>of their capability to do so, and able to identify the potential outcomes of 
<br>available behaviors and use this information to guide (or inhibit) their actions. As Bandura 
<br>(2001) states, “To make their way successfully through a complex world full of challenges and 
<br>hazards, people have to make good judgments about their capabilities, anticipate probable effects 
<br>of different events and courses of action, size up sociocultural opportunities and constraints, and 
<br>regulate their behavior accordingly” (p. 3)
<br>
<br>As such, it is a model that promotes the agency of the learners as a means of not 
<br>only constructing knowledge, but also as a skill through which constructed knowledge can be 
<br>applied outside of the classroom to improve one’s life circumstances and the status of one’s 
<br>community (Freire, 2014). It is, therefore, an ideal method for promoting both learner agency 
<br>and changemaking within the context 
<br>
<br>This means existing models like Lean startup and Effectuation also have an agency of its own. They are designed to take over or impact agency of the entrepreneurial actor in a significant way.

Transfer is not a discrete activity, but is rather an integral part of the learning process. 
<br>
<br>Many animals have socially transmitted behavioural traditions, but human culture appears unique in that it is cumulative, i.e. human cultural traits increase in diversity and complexity over time. It is often suggested that high-fidelity cultural transmission is necessary for cumulative culture to occur through refinement, a process known as ‘ratcheting’, but this hypothesis has never been formally evaluated. We discuss processes of information transmission and loss of traits from a cognitive viewpoint alongside other cultural processes of novel invention (generation of entirely new traits), modification (refinement of existing traits) and combination (bringing together two established traits to generate a new trait).

It describes quick and effective problem solving using only the materials at hand.  For footwear, the heel is the obvious component to experiment with, the combination of unexpected form with unlikely materials achieving the full Adhocism effect.<br>&nbsp;Born from the conjunction of ad-hoc,
meaning “for this particular purpose,” and ism, shorthand for a movement in the arts, the combination
<br>thrives in many places. Adhocism denotes a principle of action having speed or economy and purpose or
utility, and it prospers like most hybrids on the edge of&nbsp;respectability. Basically, as in architecture, it involves

<br>1. Always ASTRONAUT: This is the default mode of ASTRONAUT Loop Framework. This mode involves continues exploration and learning across 4 adaptive dimensions(Cognition/ Agents socio-physical/Artifact(If any)/ Environment +) and 9 exploratory dimensions(ASTRONAUT +). The + indicates that you can add your own. 
<br>
<br>2. SOMA Centric: SOMA in this framework means Socio-Material Artifact. ASTRONAUT framework considers entrepreneurship as a process of creating a SOMA. In the SO MA centric mode the entire attention of the framework narrows down for the creation of a SOMA. The purpose here is SOMA/ Environment Fitness.&nbsp;</p>
